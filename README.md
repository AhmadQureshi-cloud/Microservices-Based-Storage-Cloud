# Microservices-Based-Storage-Cloud
A secure digital assets storage system with multilevel security protocol for both data in transit and data at rest.
System would be deployable over the intranet protected from the internet world.
The system would be designed as per cloud computing architectures including Micro-service and service discovery working in collaboration without internet.
Network connections would be there of course but over a local area network (LAN)/ VPN /Intranet .
